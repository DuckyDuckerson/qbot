# Quackbot
================

Quack is a simple bot that bullies users, creates voice chats and keeps track of xp.

To run the bot you need to 
- Make sure you have docker installed and running on your machine.
### If you have other docker containers running on the same machine this script will stop them, and delete them. So be careful.
- Then just run the runme.sh script and the bot will start.

I have the bot running on a raspberry pi 4 with 4gb of ram and it works fine. I have also tested it on a macOS machine and it works fine there too. **Not sure about windows.**

The bot is still a mess, but I am working on it. Slowly improving it.

I will add more to this README as I go along.
